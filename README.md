This is the app I developed for a project where I use an ESP32 microcontroller to remotely launch skyrockets. 
The system is designed to control fireworks safely via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, allowing timed or manual launches through the mobile interface. It combines real-time feedback, 
GPIO pin control, and safety mechanisms to prevent accidental ignition. The project showcases both hardware integration and software control in an embedded IoT environment.
